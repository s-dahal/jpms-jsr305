# jpms-activej-bytebuf
The jpms-activej-bytebuf repository is dedicated to making the activej-bytebuf module compliant with the Java Platform Module System (JPMS). This compliance ensures that the activej-bytebuf library can be seamlessly integrated into modular Java applications, leveraging the benefits of JPMS such as improved encapsulation, security, and maintainability.

## Features

* **JPMS Compliance:** The library is packaged as a JPMS module, enabling better encapsulation and dependency management in Java projects.
* **Ease of Use:** Simple integration into projects using JPMS.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

* **Java 11 or higher:** JPMS was introduced in Java 9, so a minimum of Java 11 is recommended for compatibility and support.
* **Maven or Gradle:** For dependency management and building the project.

Add the following dependency to your pom.xml:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>dev.ikm.jpms</groupId>
	<artifactId>activej-bytebuf</artifactId>
    <version>${latest-jpms-activej-bytebuf-version}</version>
</dependency>
```

Add the following dependency to your build.gradle:
```groovy
implementation 'dev.ikm.jpms:jsr305:${latest-jpms-activej-bytebuf-version}'
```

In your module descriptor (module-info.java), declare the dependency on the jpms-activej-bytebuf module:

```java
module your.module.name {
    requires dev.ikm.jpms.activej.bytebuf;
}
```
